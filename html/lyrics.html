            Take me back to the city
            Yeah, call my city where everybody knows my name
            Take me back to the people
            That call my people, yeah, I'm a long, long way
            From my city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
            From my city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

            This one goes out to the ones that feel like an underdog
            Used to write me off, now they're changin' up the dialog
            Raise a glass to the past and all 'em that we're provin' wrong
            You can take me out the city, but I brought my fam along, yeah
            And the memories are playin' in my head
            But I won't let 'em burn me again
            I came too far just to let go
            Baby, I'm comin' back home, comin' back home

            Take me back to the city
            Yeah, call my city where everybody knows my name
            Take me back to the people
            That call my people, yeah, I'm a long, long way
            From my city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
            From my city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

            And my city knew my name before the name came
            Livin' in the fast lane, ain't have to change lanes
            Had a hoodie on my head, before the rain came
            Sometimes family and friends, that's the same thing
            I thought I knew all about pain, 'til the pain came
            But I'm still in the hall of fame, 'cause I ain't hate the game
            Never cared 'bout what it is or what it was
            Never life your life in fear, live in love
            For my city, shed tears and shed blood
            In my city, I lost the ones that I love
            
            Take me back to the city
            Yeah, call my city where everybody knows my name
            Take me back to the people
            That call my people, yeah, I'm a long, long way
            Take me back to the city
            Yeah, call my city where everybody knows my name
            Take me back to the people
            That call my people, yeah, yeah, I'm on my way
            From my city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
            (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, take me back, take me back, take me back)
            From my city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
            (My city, my city)
            My city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
            (Take me back, take me back, hmm-mmm)
            My city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
            My city, my city
